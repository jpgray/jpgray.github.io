# Sparta_Global_gamesWeekProject

"Trials of a Spartan" is a project produced by Jon Gray as part of his training in HTML, CSS and Javascript for Sparta Global.
This was produced using these fundamentals, including CCS grid to produce a web game.
This was produced over the course of one week only.
All audio and image files have been sourced online, and the game is for educational purposes only.

"Trials of a Spartan" is a game where you must carefully choose from your action options in order to survive each encounter in turn.
Your opponent is randomly generated, but for a few special encounters.
Once you have successfully made it past 20 enemies, there is a boss fight, and here the game ends, one way or another.
Mechanics for the game are deliberately hidden to allow players the feeling of progress when they think they are finally understanding the strongest course of action.
Give it a try, and good luck!
